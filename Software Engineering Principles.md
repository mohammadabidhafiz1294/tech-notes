## Introduction

**Software engineering principles** are fundamental guidelines and best practices that are essential for developing high-quality, efficient, reliable, scalable, and maintainable software. These principles act as a "north star," guiding developers and organizations in making informed architectural decisions, reducing technical debt, improving collaboration, and lowering maintenance costs over time.
## Background

The broader field of **software engineering** is a discipline combining computer science and engineering, focused on the systematic design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. It involves applying engineering principles and computer programming expertise to create software systems that meet user needs.

The discipline emerged in the **1960s** during a "software crisis" characterized by projects that were over budget, exceeded deadlines, required extensive debugging, and often failed to meet consumer needs or were never completed. In response, the **first software engineering conference was held by NATO in 1968**, where initial guidelines and best practices were established, and the term "software engineering" itself gained prominence, associated with Professor Friedrich L. Bauer and Margaret Hamilton. The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) was later established in 1984 to improve the practice of software engineering.
