Ruby is the programming language used to build Jekyll, a popular static site generator. Jekyll transforms plain text files written in Markdown, HTML, or other formats, along with templates and configuration, into a complete static website. The generation process follows a serial structure with several steps. Here's an explanation of how Ruby generates a Jekyll static site and the serial structure it follows:

1. **Reading Configuration:** Jekyll starts by reading the `_config.yml` file in the root directory of your project. This file contains configuration settings for your site, such as site title, URLs, plugins, themes, and more.
    
2. **File Collection:** Jekyll identifies and collects various types of files in your project directory, including Markdown files for posts and pages, HTML templates, SASS style-sheets, and static assets like images and JavaScript.
    
3. **Front Matter Parsing:** For each Markdown file (posts, pages, collections), Jekyll parses the front matter. Front matter is the metadata at the top of a file enclosed in YAML or JSON. It includes information like the layout to use, the title, date, and custom variables.
    
4. **Markdown and Liquid Processing:** Jekyll processes Markdown content using a Markdown processor (typically Kramdown) and Liquid templates. Liquid is a template language that allows you to insert dynamic content, logic, and variables into your templates.
    
5. **Layout Rendering:** Jekyll uses layout templates defined in the `_layouts` directory to structure the content. Layouts include placeholders that are replaced with actual content from posts and pages.
    
6. **Page and Post Generation:** Jekyll generates individual pages and posts using the processed Markdown content and layout templates. Each page/post is rendered into an HTML file in the `_site` directory, which represents the output of the generation process.
    
7. **SASS Compilation:** If you're using SASS for style-sheets, Jekyll compiles SASS files in the `_sass` directory into CSS files, applying any custom styling defined in your project.
    
8. **Static Asset Copying:** Jekyll copies static assets (images, fonts, JavaScript files) from the `assets` directory to the `_site` directory, maintaining the same directory structure.
    
9. **Plugin Execution (Optional):** If you're using Jekyll plugins, they're executed at this stage. Plugins can extend Jekyll's functionality, adding features like SEO optimization, image processing, and more.
    
10. **Output Directory Generation:** Jekyll generates the `_site` directory, which contains the final static files ready to be hosted on a web server. The `_site` directory mirrors the structure of your project.
    
11. **Serve or Deploy:** You can use the `jekyll serve` command to run a local development server and preview your site. When you're ready, you can deploy the generated `_site` directory to a web server or hosting platform to make your static site live.
    

Overall, Ruby and Jekyll work together to automate the process of generating static websites from structured content and templates. The serial structure ensures that each step is performed in a logical sequence, resulting in a complete and ready-to-use static site.
