### PPA

**PPA** stands for **Personal Package Archive**. It’s a type of **software repository** provided by developers or third parties on **Launchpad** (Ubuntu’s platform) that allows you to install and update software that may not be available—or up-to-date—in the official Ubuntu repositories.

### 💡 Why Use a PPA?

- To **get the latest version** of a package (like Ansible)
    
- To install software that is **not included** in default Ubuntu packages
    
- Maintained by **developers or communities** outside of Ubuntu's core team

EX- ``sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ansible/ansible``
This tells Ubuntu:
> “Check this external source for Ansible updates.”
