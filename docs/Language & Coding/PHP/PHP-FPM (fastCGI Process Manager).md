## INTRO-setup

#PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is a PHP FastCGI (Fast Common Gateway Interface) implementation with added features for improved performance and scalability. It is designed to handle PHP requests efficiently and manage PHP processes.

Here's how PHP-FPM works:

1. PHP-FPM operates as a separate service or process that runs alongside a web server, such as Nginx or Apache.
    
2. When a PHP file is requested by a client (e.g., a web browser), the web server passes the request to PHP-FPM using the FastCGI protocol.
    
3. PHP-FPM receives the PHP request and processes it. It creates separate worker processes to handle multiple requests concurrently, thereby improving performance.
    
4. Once the PHP request is processed, PHP-FPM sends the response back to the web server, which then sends it to the client.
    

To link PHP-FPM with a WordPress site, you typically need to follow these steps:

1. Install and configure PHP-FPM: Depending on your server environment, you may need to install PHP-FPM separately. The installation process varies depending on the operating system and server software you're using. Refer to the documentation or support resources for your specific setup.
    
2. Configure your web server: You need to configure your web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) to work with PHP-FPM. This involves specifying the PHP-FPM address or socket in the server configuration. Again, the configuration steps differ based on the web server you're using. Consult the documentation or resources for your particular web server.
    
3. Connect WordPress to PHP-FPM: Once PHP-FPM is installed and configured, you need to ensure that WordPress is configured to use it. Typically, this involves modifying the `php.ini` or `php-fpm.conf` file to set the correct PHP-FPM address or socket. The exact steps may depend on your hosting environment or server setup.

> 	It's worth noting that the specific configuration steps may vary depending on your server environment and the hosting provider you're using. If you're not familiar with server administration, it's recommended to consult your hosting provider's documentation or contact their support for assistance in configuring PHP-FPM with your WordPress site.


## Why Needed #PHP-FPM

1. PHP Execution: PHP-FPM allows Nginx to communicate with the PHP interpreter and execute PHP code within WordPress. It serves as the bridge between Nginx and PHP, handling the PHP processing and generating the HTML output.
    
2. Performance and Scalability: PHP-FPM uses a pool of PHP processes to handle PHP requests. This improves performance and scalability by efficiently managing PHP process creation, handling concurrent requests, and controlling resource usage.
    
3. Separation of Concerns: Separating the web server (Nginx) from the PHP interpreter (PHP-FPM) allows for better modularity and scalability. It enables you to scale each component independently, optimizing resource allocation and ensuring efficient handling of web server and PHP processing tasks.
    
4. Security: PHP-FPM provides additional security measures by isolating PHP processes from the web server. It helps prevent unauthorized access and protects against various security vulnerabilities.

> Overall, PHP-FPM is a critical component in this setup as it allows Nginx to interface with PHP and execute WordPress code. It enables efficient PHP processing, enhances performance, improves scalability, and provides security benefits for running WordPress with Nginx as the web server.


## Configure #PHP-FPM for Web Server to Connect Wordpress

Configuring WordPress to use PHP-FPM involves modifying the `php.ini` or `php-fpm.conf` file. Here's an example of how you can set it up:

1. Locate your `php.ini` file: The location of the `php.ini` file depends on your server configuration. Common paths include `/etc/php/php.ini` or `/etc/php/7.4/fpm/php.ini`. Use the `phpinfo()` function in a PHP file to find the exact location of your `php.ini` file.
    
2. Open the `php.ini` file in a text editor.
    
3. Search for the `cgi.fix_pathinfo` directive. Uncomment it (remove the semicolon at the beginning of the line) if necessary, and set its value to `0` to disable path info.
    
4. Search for the `fastcgi_pass` directive. It specifies the address or socket of the PHP-FPM process.
    
    If using a TCP/IP address, the line might look like:

```nano
fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
```

  If using a socket file, the line might look like:

```nano
fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock; 
```

 Update the value according to your PHP-FPM configuration. Consult your server administrator or hosting provider if you're unsure about the correct value.
    
5. Save the changes and exit the text editor.
    
6. Restart your web server and PHP-FPM service to apply the changes.
    

Once these steps are completed, WordPress should be configured to use PHP-FPM for processing PHP requests.
