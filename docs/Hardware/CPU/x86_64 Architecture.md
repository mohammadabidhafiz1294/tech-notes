 x86_64 (also known as x64, AMD64, and Intel 64) is a 64-bit version of the x86 instruction set. It was developed by AMD and introduced in 2003. x86_64 is a backwards-compatible extension of the x86 architecture, meaning that x86_64 processors can run both 32-bit and 64-bit programs.

x86_64 offers a number of advantages over 32-bit architectures, including:

- Increased memory addressing capabilities: x86_64 processors can address up to 256TB of memory, compared to 4GB for 32-bit processors.
- Improved performance: x86_64 processors can execute more instructions per clock cycle than 32-bit processors.
- Increased parallelism: x86_64 processors can support more simultaneous threads than 32-bit processors.

x86_64 is now the dominant architecture for desktop and server processors. It is used in a wide range of applications, including operating systems, web servers, databases, and high-performance computing.

Here are some examples of popular Linux distributions that support x86_64:

- Debian
- Ubuntu
- Fedora
- Arch Linux
- Gentoo

If you are building a new Linux system, or if you are upgrading your existing system, I recommend that you choose an x86_64 processor. It will give you the best performance and the most flexibility.
