Symptoms: The application is slow and unresponsive. Users are reporting that they are getting timeout errors when they try to access the application.

Telemetry data: The metrics show that the CPU usage is high and the memory usage is high. The distributed traces show that the requests are taking a long time to complete.

Distributed tracing: The distributed traces show that the requests are spending a lot of time in the microservice that handles the database. The microservice that handles user authentication is also taking a long time to respond.

Analysis: The analysis of the telemetry data and the distributed traces shows that the database and the user authentication microservices are overloaded.

Troubleshooting: Troubleshooting would involve fixing the root cause of the database overload and the user authentication microservice overload. This could involve updating the database schema, adding more capacity to the database, optimizing the database queries, updating the user authentication microservice code, or adding more capacity to the user authentication microservice.

To reproduce the issue, you could try to increase the load on the application by running more concurrent requests. You could also try to access the application from different geographic locations.

To troubleshoot the issue in production, you could use the following steps:

1. Collect telemetry data from the application
2. Analyze the telemetry data to identify the microservices that are failing
3. Use distributed tracing to track requests as they flow through the microservices architecture
4. Identify the root cause of the failure in each microservice
5. Fix the root cause of the failure in each microservice
6. Redeploy the microservices
7. Monitor the application to ensure that the failure does not recur

With logging, it would take a long time to identify the microservices that are failing because the logs would be scattered across different microservices. It would also be difficult to correlate the logs from different microservices. Additionally, the logs would only provide a limited view of the application’s behavior, which would make it difficult to identify the root cause of the failure.

With distributed tracing, the microservices that are failing can be identified quickly because distributed tracing can track requests as they flow through the microservices architecture. Additionally, distributed tracing can provide a more granular view of the application’s behavior, which can help with identifying the root cause of the failure more quickly.

For example, let’s say that the application is slow and unresponsive. Using logging, it might take hours or even days to identify the microservices that are failing and to understand why they are failing. However, using distributed tracing, the microservices that are failing can be identified in minutes or even seconds. Additionally, distributed tracing can provide information about the specific requests that are failing, which can help to identify the root cause of the failure more quickly.

As a result, the MTTR would be significantly lower if distributed tracing was used instead of logging.
