## Introduction

**Software engineering principles** are foundational guidelines and best practices that help developers create high-quality, efficient, reliable, scalable, and maintainable software. They act as a "north star," guiding developers and organizations in making informed architectural decisions, reducing technical debt, improving collaboration, and lowering maintenance costs over time.

The broader field of **software engineering** itself is a branch of both computer science and engineering, focused on the systematic design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. It involves applying engineering principles and computer programming expertise to ensure software systems meet user needs. The discipline emerged in the 1960s, driven by a "software crisis" that highlighted problems like budget overruns, missed deadlines, and extensive debugging needs. Early efforts, such as the 1968 NATO conference, established guidelines and best practices for software development.
