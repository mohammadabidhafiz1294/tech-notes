# Obsidian Vault Backup

This repository contains backups of my Obsidian vault, which I use to store my notes and other documents.

## Why Backup My Obsidian Vault?

Obsidian is a powerful note-taking application that I use every day to manage my notes, research, and writing projects. However, like any other software, it's not immune to data loss or corruption. That's why I regularly backup my vault to ensure that I don't lose any of my important data.

## What's Included in the Backup?

The backup includes all the files and folders in my Obsidian vault, including any attached files, images, and other media. I use the built-in backup feature in Obsidian to create these backups, which are stored in a timestamped ZIP file in the "Backups" folder in my vault.

## How to Use the Backup

If you want to use the backup to restore your Obsidian vault to a previous state, simply download the ZIP file for the backup you want to use and extract it to a new folder. Then, open Obsidian and select "Open folder as vault" from the File menu. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the backup and select it. Obsidian will then open the backup as your vault, allowing you to access your notes and other documents.
