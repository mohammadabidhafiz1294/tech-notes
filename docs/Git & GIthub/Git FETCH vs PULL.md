The `git fetch` and `git pull` commands are both used to update your local repository with the changes from a remote repository. However, there is a subtle difference between the two commands.

1. **`git fetch`:** This command only downloads the latest changes from the remote repository and updates the remote-tracking branches in your local repository. It does not automatically merge or update your current branch. It is useful when you want to see what changes have been made in the remote repository without incorporating those changes into your working branch immediately. After fetching, you can inspect the changes and decide how to integrate them.
    
    Usage: `git fetch <remote>`
    
    Example: `git fetch origin`
    
2. **`git pull`:** This command fetches the latest changes from the remote repository, just like `git fetch`. However, it also automatically merges the changes from the remote branch into your current branch. It is essentially a combination of `git fetch` followed by `git merge`. This command is convenient when you want to update your working branch with the latest changes from the remote repository.
    
    Usage: `git pull <remote> <branch>`
    
    Example: `git pull origin main`
    


> It's worth noting that `git pull` can be configured to use different merge strategies, such as rebase, by setting the appropriate configuration options. The default behavior is to perform a merge.

In summary, if you want to retrieve changes from a remote repository but want to inspect them before merging, use `git fetch`. If you want to fetch the changes and automatically merge them into your current branch, use `git pull`.
