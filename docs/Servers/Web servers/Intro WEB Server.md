### Summary

A web server is a software application that serves web content, such as web pages, images, videos, and other resources, to clients over the internet. Its primary functionality is to handle incoming HTTP requests from clients (typically web browsers) and respond with the requested content.

Here are some key functionalities of a web server:

1. Request Handling: Web servers receive HTTP requests from clients and process them. This includes parsing the request, extracting information such as the requested URL, headers, and parameters.
    
2. Content Serving: The web server retrieves the requested content from the server's file system or a backend application and sends it back as an HTTP response to the client. This can include static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) or dynamically generated content.
    
3. Routing: Web servers can handle different routes or URLs and direct requests to the appropriate resources. They can match URLs to specific files or trigger specific actions on the server.
    
4. Protocol Handling: Web servers understand and implement the HTTP protocol, enabling communication with clients. They handle various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and process headers and cookies.
    
5. Security: Web servers often include security features to protect against common web attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and SQL injection. They can enforce HTTPS encryption, handle authentication, and implement access control mechanisms.
    
6. Caching: Web servers can implement caching mechanisms to store and serve static content or frequently accessed data, improving performance and reducing the load on backend systems.
    
7. Load Balancing: In high-traffic scenarios, web servers can distribute incoming requests across multiple servers or instances to balance the load and ensure optimal performance and availability.
    
8. Logging and Monitoring: Web servers often generate logs that record information about incoming requests, errors, and performance metrics. These logs can be used for troubleshooting, auditing, and monitoring purposes.
    

> Popular web servers include Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services), and LiteSpeed. They provide the fundamental infrastructure for hosting websites and web applications and play a crucial role in delivering content to clients over the internet.
